<a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a> while grappling with the UK neighbourhood statistics API.</p>
<p>The visualization shows income inequality along London tube lines. My only rule
here was to use <em>only</em> d3 (no jquery!). I can confirm that DOM APIs are indeed
horrible, and that&#39;s without even trying to support IE.</p>
<p>For what it&#39;s worth I don&#39;t think the d3 API is very nice either, unless you
<em>really</em> like lots of chaining. I just don&#39;t find long chains of method calls
very readable.</p>

could take memorable pictures of themselves in a wide variety of silly outfits.
Being a young musician, he couldn&#39;t afford the real deal, so I was given the
task of hacking one together using an old netbook and his DSLR.</p>
<p>The hastily-written is code responsible for some very embarrassing pictures. It
works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A nodejs server script serves a single page with some client code.</li>
<li>The client code uses <code>getUserMedia</code> to display the webcam image on the screen,
as well as a helpful &#39;press a key to take a picture&#39; message.</li>
<li>When a drunk guest presses a key, the client notifies the server over
websockets using <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a>.</li>
<li>The server then shells out to <a href="http://www.gphoto.org/proj/gphoto2/">gphoto2</a>, which takes 4 pictures using the
attached camera balanced just above the webcam.</li>
<li>Once the pictures are ready, the server thumbnails them and notifies the
client over websockets.</li>
<li>The client displays the images, everyone is amused.</li>
</ul>

was picking up steam in 2011. I was just getting to grips with javascript, and
coming from python I found the indented, curly-brace free language far more
readable.</p>
<p>I was looking for some tools to generate documentation for a project, and came
across <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/">Docco</a>. It could generate some nice-looking annotated source pages,
and was written by none other than the creator of CoffeeScript. But after
playing around with it I couldn&#39;t really see any benefit from generating
annotated source pages - why not just read the source? The comments are in
there.</p>
<p>I needed something that would show useful documentation for complex class
hierarchies spread across multiple files. After some messing about with the
CoffeeScript compiler, I had a working documentation tool.</p>
<p>It relies on a commenting convention based on python docstrings, so it might not
be an ideal fit for existing codebases, but if you&#39;re starting a new project and
you have a python background, you might like it. Have a look at <a href="http://wintersmith.io/docs/">the lovely
wintersmith.io docs</a> to see what it can do.</p>
</article></div><div class="wrapper odd"><article id="httptrail"><h3><a href="https://github.com/omarkhan/httptrail">httptrail</a> <a href="#httptrail">&para;</a></h3><p>I needed a simple way of logging requests and responses to a web api backend to
help with writing integration tests. I couldn&#39;t find one, so I wrote this
node.js based logging http proxy.</p>

it to test, benchmark, and confuse web crawlers.</p>

images to flesh out a prototype? This command line tool fetches photos with a
Creative Commons licence using the flickr API.</p>
